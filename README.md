## Shortly
MatriQ project explores optimal matrix multiplication algorithms with quantum computing.

## Resources
  - Video presentation of the project:
  - A longer and detailed scientific document with an introduction to how computationally harvest matrix multiplication algorithms
  - Implementation (working on):
    - QUBO formulation for Amazon Braket and D-wave Leap
    - QAOA formulation with Pennylane
    - Nvidia GPU-accelerated implementation
